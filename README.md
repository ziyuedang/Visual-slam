# Visual SLAM from Scratch on KITTI

A feature-based visual SLAM system implemented from the ground up  
using the KITTI Odometry dataset.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals
- Build a working feature-based Visual SLAM pipeline
- Practice core 3D computer vision skills: feature detection, epipolar geometry, 
  bundle adjustment, and loop closure
- Evaluate trajectory accuracy on KITTI sequences

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/visual-slam.git
cd visual-slam
# create environment and install dependencies
